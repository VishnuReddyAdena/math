# Math Operations in Python

This repository contains two simple Python programs that perform basic mathematical operations using user input. The programs demonstrate the use of functions, recursion, and the `math` module for calculations.

## üìÅ Files

### 1. `factorial.py`
This script calculates the factorial of a user-provided number using a recursive function.

**Functionality:**
- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Computes the factorial using a recursive approach.
- Displays the result.

### 2. `math.py`
This script performs three mathematical operations on a given number using the `math` module.

**Functionality:**
- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Calculates and displays:
  - Square root
  - Natural logarithm (base `e`)
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
